Case study in power bi

In this Power BI case study, I explored a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. I carried out exploratory data analysis and used DAX to help build powerful visualizations. I finished analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.

At the end, I finalize the case study by making design changes to my report that provides a clean, branded design.
